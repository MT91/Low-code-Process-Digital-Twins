# How Low-code Platforms Support Process Digital Twins
This repository contains the supporting materials for the manuscript titled *"How Low-code Platforms Support Process Digital Twins"*, currently under submission to the *37th International Conferences on Advanced Information Systems Engineering*. These materials are provided to enable further exploration of the three case studies (CSs) requiring the implementation of real-world processes, each regarding a different application domain and problem.

## Abstract of the Study
Process Digital Twins (PDTs) are emerging as a feasible solution for modeling, monitoring, and optimizing business processes, by providing real-time, data-driven insights into operational workflows. However, designing, developing, and maintaining PDTs can be complex and resource-intensive, often requiring highly specialized expertise in software engineering and domain-specific processes. 
In this paper, we propose leveraging low-code development platforms (LCDPs) to simplify and accelerate the creation and deployment of PDTs utilizing the intuitive, visual development environments and pre-built components they provide.
To evaluate the suitability of  LCDPs for supporting PDTs, we conducted a literature study identifying 11 key characteristics that define PDTs. Using these 11 characteristics as a foundational framework, we analyzed whether LCDPs can effectively support the design, development, and execution of PDTs. We applied this framework in three different case studies, examining how LCDPs meet the requirements for PDT implementation across various scenarios. Our findings highlight the ease of adoption and cost-efficiency offered by LCDPs but reveal challenges, especially in scalability.
