## Order CS
In the **Orders management system CS**, the information system exposes user interfaces through a web application, where users can monitor the status and the information related to an order was implemented with the same approach, where the order's initial status can be placed in, *started*, meaning that it will not be considered until the order is in draft.  When the order is ready to be processed, the user moves it to the *Ready* state, and the workflow executes one of the branches in **a**. Again, a switch node checks the order's current status and takes the branch as we modeled the process. 

The PDT manages the orchestration of services in the defined workflow depending on the specified fields in the system, see **c** in the [Figure](https://github.com/MT91/Low-code-Process-Digital-Twins/blob/main/Order_CS/Orders%20CS.pdf), where the user must specify the required information to move the order from one status to another. For instance, until the *requestSigned* field does not contain a pdf, the system will not allow the transition from Started to *RUP assigned*. Indeed, when the general director assigns a RUP to the order, the item moves to the status of *RUP assigned*, and the RUP will receive emails with the instructions. Moreover, this branch also includes emails to the financial office to check the funding coverage for the material to be acquired, automatically moving the order into the status "funds check".  The last status of the order is *Compliance OK* and requires that the user uploads a signed document attesting the compliance of the received material with the request. The system automates several tasks, including notifications to relevant parties (e.g., financial office, RUP) and checks for document uploads (e.g., compliance documents), as for the first case study, alternating human and automated tasks impacting the status.
